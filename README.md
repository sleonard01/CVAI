The cranial vault asymmetry index (CVAI) is a measurement used 
to quantify the degree of asymmetry in a baby's head, often associated 
with deformational plagiocephaly. It is calculated by dividing the 
difference between the lengths of the two diagonal measurements of the head 
by the longer diagonal, then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. 
A normal CVAI is generally considered to be less than 3.5%, according to 
the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services.
